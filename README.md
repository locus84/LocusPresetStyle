# Locus Preset Style For Unity3D

## Introduction

This GitHub repository is for a Unity3D framework that enables developers to easily style their components using a CSS-like approach. The framework utilizes a built-in preset system that allows developers to modify styles by simply dragging and dropping components and making changes in the preset inspector. The stylesheet is a scriptable object that can be easily modified.

## Pros
- Allows for a more organized and efficient way to manage and apply styles to Unity3D components. 
- Allows for easy modification and reuse of styles. 
- Designed for small-scale management of styles and can be especially useful for developers who find it difficult to manage styles using only prefab systems. 
- Can improve the overall design and consistency of a Unity3D project. 
- The framework works only on design time, which means there is no runtime overhead.
